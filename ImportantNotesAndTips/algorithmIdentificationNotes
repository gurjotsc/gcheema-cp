"number of ways" or "how many ways" or "possible ways" etc. == DP (combinatorics?)
I think "Subarrays" == dp or prefix typically

**Note the prefixes (in, pre, post) tell you where the root goes. Then its just left and right
 Inorder (Left, Root, Right) (BST)
 Preorder (Root, Left, Right)
 Postorder (Left, Right, Root)

if the question has to do directly with numerical properties, think of binary representations
if the question has to do with even and odd, think of binary representations
    evens will have 0 in the rightmost position while odds will have 1

From gfg
Eg: N<<i (N: first operand, i: second operand)
Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
Or in other words left shifting an integer “x” with an integer “y” denoted as ‘(x<<y)’ is equivalent to multiplying x with 2^y (2 raised to power y).

Eg: N>>i (N: first operand, i: second operand)

Takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
In other words right shifting an integer “x” with an integer “y” denoted as ‘(x>>y)‘ is equivalent to dividing x with 2^y.
